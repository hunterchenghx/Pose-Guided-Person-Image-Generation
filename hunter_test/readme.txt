This folder contains two python files, several .npy files and several images.

pt.py and pt256.py are scripts for generating the required heat maps (18 key points) of the target pose. pt.py is for market1501 based one, and pt256.py is for deepfashion based one. Change the key_list in the script to your own poses. The key_list contains the 18 coordinates of the key point. In the draw_keypoint.pdf file, I offered my simple method to draw it using MAC or iPad.

Image files are from deep fashion dataset, market1501 dataset or COCO2017 dataset.

.npy files are some target poses generated by myself(using above the two scripts).

feed the image file and the target pose file to create your own fake image.
